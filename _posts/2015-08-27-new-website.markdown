We are happy to announce our new website, which based on Jekyll. Also, we use a theme created by us which used ZoaUI. It's a huge update, more announcements and service status will be here, and of course you can subscribe our Atom feed.

Thank you for supporting UnitedHubs. As our official working language is Simplified Chinese, most of the posts and pages there will be in Chinese.

On GTC15, we announced Piedu and inQR, and all attendees enjoyed the wonderful conference. We'd specially say "thank you" to [Meteor Development Group](https://meteor.com) and [DaoCloud](http://daocloud.io), both of which supported our wonderful GTC.

For now, you can use [Piedu](http://piedu.net), and [inQR](http://inqr.mobi) is still in progress. We will ping you on feed if Piedu meets a huge update or inQR is ready for all of you.

GTC16 is being prepared at present. We may hold this in Xiamen, Fujian, PRC. We'll make another announcement when detailed information is available.

There is an important notice: All mailboxes of LNS, which previously ended with `@lasteam.net`, are now ended with `@lns.unihubs.com`. You may modify your contact book if you have some one at LNS in your contact.
